Points to maintain good folder structure:
1. While creating components, make sure inside components you make to create another folder with page name foe whic you are building the component and inside that create files for the components
2. If using css files, make sure you are using "module.css" files only with the "page_name.module.css" name and is should be inside styles folder
3. If using any local images, make sure to make a new folder according to the the page name inside public folder
4. if working on redux store, make sure to create a new folder
